# HANDS

This app's purpose is to teach me better 3d animation and website building practises while doing everything in new framework: Vue.

Hands are your opponent, they've got character, temper and will to win. Animations and dialogue is added to reflect that.
It's an expiriance.

## Planned games:

1. Rock-paper-scissors
2. Chess
3. Cards (general)

## TODO

- Add more animations (need ~40-50) in blender
- optimize three.js speed
- Add main menu
- Add backgroud animation
- Add dialogue logic and translation dictionary
